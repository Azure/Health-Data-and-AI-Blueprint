# Azure HIPAA/HITRUST Health Data and AI - with (IaaS Extension) 

## Deployment guide

The components for deploying the solution can be downloaded from the
[Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - HIPAA/HITRUST Health Data and AI repository on Github.](http://aka.ms/healthblueprint)  For integration with PowerShell, it is necessary to have [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
installed.

![](images/Warning-sign.png) **CAUTION** The script adds domain users to the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant that you specify. We recommend creating a new Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant to test this solution.

![](images/Warning-sign.png) **CAUTION** It is recommended you use a [clean Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal) (or similar) VM to deploy the solution to ensure that the correct PowerShell modules get loaded. 


![](images/Warning-sign.png) **CAUTION**   If you encounter any issues during the deployment, see [FAQ and troubleshooting](faq.md)


![](images/Warning-sign.png) **CAUTION**   Deployment script must be monitored while the deployment is running. You will be prompted for the global admin username/password during the deployment.

![](images/Warning-sign.png) **CAUTION**   To add enhanced protection of the deployment, it is highlight recommended that MFA be used on ALL deployments. 

## Deploy the solution

You need to copy, or [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository. Once you have a copy of the  Blueprint automation, you can deploy the solution by using the  **deploy.ps1** PowerShell script. Once the PaaS solution deployment has been created, you can then deploy the IaaS extension element using deployIaaS.ps1, as documented below.

## Required administrator roles

The person installing the blueprint must be in the Global Administrator role in the AAD. The installing account must be an Azure subscription administrator for the subscription being used. If the person doing the install is not in both of these role, the installation will fail.

Further, the install is not designed to work with MSDN subscriptions due to the tight integration with AAD. A standard Azure account must be used. If needed, get a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=ms-docs-dastarr) with credit to spend for installing the blueprint solution and running its demos.

1.  Once the repository has been copied, or cloned change your working directory to
    **Deployment**:
```
cd  .\Deployment\
```


2.  Run **deploy.ps1** with the **installModules** switch to install and verify all
    necessary powershell modules are ready:
```
.\deploy.ps1 -installModules
```
  - It is recommended that if an error is flagged during deployment, that the errors be resolved prior to proceeding or retrying.
  - Time to deploy the solution will be approximately 25 minutes.

3.  Once the modules are installed, run **deploy.ps1** again to deploy
    the solution. For detailed usage instructions, see **deploy.ps1 usage**

   - NOTE: The script asks you to supply a value for the
**globalAdminPassword** parameter; enter the password for the
administrative account you are using for the **-globalAdminUsername**
parameter. The script then deploys the solution, which may take some
time, monitoring the 25 minute deployment is recommended, since during the deployment Global username, and Password pop up dialog windows will appear.

   - The script will be complete when the results of the **\\deployment\\output\\\<deployment-prefix\>-deploymentOutput.json** displayed onscreen.

##  deploy.ps1 usage


Deploys or manages the Azure Solution for Healthcare.

**Example 1: Installing required modules**
```
            .\deploy.ps1 -installModules
```

This command validates,and installs missing PowerShell modules
that the solution requires.

**Example 2: Deploying the solution in a test environment**
```
.\deploy.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <prefix>
             -tenantId <tenant-id>
             -tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
             -subscriptionId <subscription-id>
             -globalAdminUsername <username>
             -deploymentPassword <password>
             -enableMFA

```
This command deploys the solution and sets a single common password for all solution users, for testing purposes.



**Uninstall the solution**
```
.\deploy.ps1 -clearDeploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> 
             -tenantId <tenant-id>
             -subscriptionId <subscription-id>
             -tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
             -globalAdminUsername <username>
             -clearDeployment

``` 
Uninstalls the solution, removing all resource groups, service principles, AD applications, and AD users.

NOTE- Do not uninstall the solution if you are going to deploy the Health Extension.
 
##  deployIaaS.ps1 usage (Health Extension)

DeployIaaS.ps1 should be run once the deployment of the PaaS solution has completed successfully. This health extension will provide additional capabilities, including the addition of at Windows Server VM, and SQL server deployment.The purpose of the extension is to show-case best practices such as the following:

1.	“Start Secure” – enable security capabilities and monitoring of the IaaS VM work-load before any sensitive data or work-load processing takes place.
2.	Extend the existing PaaS sample to show secure co-existence between PaaS and IaaS VM work-load elements.
3.	Illustrate recently introduced security and deployment capabilities of ASC, ARM templates, and powershell automation.


```
.\deployIaaS.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <prefix>
             -tenantId <tenant-id>
             -tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
             -subscriptionId <subscription-id>
             -globalAdminUsername <username>
             -deploymentPassword <password>
             -enableMFA

```
This command deploys the IaaS solution for testing purposes.

## Extension deployment Example
```
.\deployIaaS.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <prefix> [Any max 5 length prefix e.g. demo1, test99, etc]
             -tenantId <tenant-id> [“XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX”] 
             -tenantDomain <tenant-domain> [“XXXXXXXX.com”]
             -subscriptionId <subscription-id> [XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX]
             -globalAdminUsername <username> [Pass provided Username, if any]
             
```

## Parameters for deploy.ps1 and deployIaaS.ps1

At least one parameter must be present to successfully run the script.

-clearDeployment
Uninstalls the solution, removing all resource groups, service principles, AD applications, and AD users. Must be used with the -clearDeploymentPrefix switch

-clearDeploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> 
Uninstalls the solution, removing all resource groups, service principles, AD applications, and AD users. Must be used with -cleardeployment switch

-deploymentPassword <password>
If this parameter is set, all of the passwords used within the solution are set to the supplied value. The deploymentPassword parameter is intended for testing purposes and should not be used in a production environment. If this parameter is not used, the script generates and displays strong passwords for every role/account.

-deploymentPrefix <prefix>
A string of 1 to 5 alphanumeric characters that is used to create distinct resource group names. If you run the script multiple times, you must choose a different prefix each time to avoid conflicts with other resources.

-enableADDomainPasswordPolicy
Only applicable to deploy.ps1.  Include this switch when deploying the solution to set the password policy to 60 days at the Domain level.  

-enableMFA
Only applicable to deploy.ps1.  Include this switch when deploying the solution to enable multi-factor authentication for solution users.  
  This feature - is optional - but highly recommended. Enabling MFA will require additional configurations outlined in the following Azure MFA documentation.
Using MFA for all administrators, including global administrators is highly recommended to prevent unauthorized use of the subscription Global Admin.

-installModules
Installs and updates all necessary PowerShell modules. Run the script with this switch before performing the deployment to ensure that all necessary modules are present.

-globalAdminUsername <username>
Typically, this is the username of the user performing the deployment. Use a valid Azure Active Directory OrgID username (example: "alex@contosohealthcare.onmicrosoft.com") rather than a Microsoft or corporate account name (example: "alex@contoso.com").

-subscriptionId <subscription-id>
For the subscription ID, sign in to the Subscriptions view in the Azure portal. The subscription you are using should be listed in the table, along with its associated subscription ID, a GUID.

-tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
The tenant domain is the default directory name listed under your account name in the dashboard followed by ".onmicrosoft.com" (example: "contosohealthcare.onmicrosoft.com").

-tenantId <tenant-id>
To find the Azure tenant ID, click Azure Active Directory in the dashboard sidebar, and under Manage, click Properties. The tenant ID is a GUID in the box labeled Directory ID.

-appInsightsPlan <level number>

Only applicable to deploy.ps1.  Provides the ability to select your Application Insights plan level. Default is set to 1.
0 – Set up App Insights with Application Insights Basic Plan.
1 – Set up App insights with Application Insights Enterprise Plan.
2 – Deploys App Insights without any billing plan.

## Uninstall solution and clean up deployment resources


To uninstall the solution, run the deployment script again with the
following parameters:
```
.\deploy.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> 
             -tenantId  <tenant-id>
             -subscriptionId <subscription-id>
             -tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
             -globalAdminUsername <username>
             -clearDeployment
```
## if deployIaaS.ps1 was used to deploy the IaaS extension, the following can be used to remove the IaaS elements:

.\deployIaaS.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> 
                 -tenantId  <tenant-id>
                 -subscriptionId <subscription-id>
                 -tenantDomain <tenant-domain>
                 -globalAdminUsername <username>
                 -clearDeployment


The script asks you to supply a value for the
**globalAdminPassword** parameter; enter the password for the
administrative account you are using for the **-globalAdminUsername**
parameter. The script then removes all resource groups, service
principles, AD applications, and AD users.

## Deploying and running the demo OVERVIEW

The following overview will provide you understanding on the provided demonstration of the blueprint. 

The Blueprint was designed to provide you a demonstration that will:
- **INGEST** data raw sources including FHIR data source
- **STORE**  sensitive information
- **ANALYZE** and predict outcomes
- **INTERACT** with the results and perditions
- **IDENTITY** management of solution
- **SECURITY** enabled features 

Upon completion deploying the solution, **IDENTITY, SECURITY** enabled features are available to be used in your **Azure Portal**. The remainder of the demonstration steps are as follows:  

- The sample dataset used throughout this demonstration can be reviewed in **Blueprint\\Deployment\\trainingdata**. 

1. **INGEST, STORE, ANALYZE (Import and Train a Machine Learning experiment)** The sample data  contains 100,000 sample, anonymized medical records. This data
   is imported, and secured using the sample functions, at the
    same time the data is used to train a sample
    [R-function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/r-quickstart)
    Machine Learning experiment created in [Azure Machine Learning
    Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/what-is-ml-studio).
    The experiment was designed to predict the duration a patient would
    likely stay in the hospital based on the health conditions collected
    in the sample data.
![](images/bulkin.png)


2. **INGEST, STORE, ANALYZE (patients admission)** Once the Experiment in Azure Machine Learning studio is trained, the
    sample applet is used to admit 10 new
    patients **.\\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\admit** by
    the care line manager (health provider). This data is stored
    securely, logged, and the Experiment provides a predicted length
    of stay for each patient.

![](images/otherin.png)

3. **INTERACT** (Data visualization) using PowerBi reflects the last step of the demonstration.

# Deploying and running the demo STEPS # 

**NOTE** Do not proceed with running the demo before following the previous instruction to configure permissions correctly; "Grant
permissions in Azure Active Directory".

## STEP 1 - Import and Train a Machine Learning experiment (Database Analyst role)


After deploying the Blueprint, the first step in
running the length-of-stay (LOS) demonstration project is for the user created by the deployment script to input the sample historical patient data into the
solution.

To input the data, navigate to the **\\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\** directory in PowerShell
and run the following script:
```
.\HealthcareDemo.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> -Operation Ingestion
```

*\<deployment-prefix\>* is the prefix you selected when installing
the solution.

To confirm that the data has been successfully ingested, log into the
Azure portal using the Danny\_DBAnalyst account. Click **SQL databases**
in the sidebar, and then click **patientdb**. Click **Data explorer
(preview)** to open an interface for executing SQL queries. To check the
number of rows in the PatientData table, run the following query:
```
SELECT COUNT (*)
  FROM [dbo].[PatientData]
```

It should return a result of 100,000 rows, representing several years'
worth of historical patient data. To check the integrity of the data,
run the following query:
```
 SELECT TOP 100 *
  FROM [dbo].[PatientData]
```

Will displays the first 100 rows from the table. You can observe that the first,
middle, and last names of each patient are now encrypted at rest in the
database.

## STEP 2 - Patient admission (Care Line Manager role)


Chris, the care line manager, adds newly admitted patients to the
database by uploading their information in FHIR format. These records
are stored in 10 individual .json files, one for each patient, in the
\\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\admit
directory.

To upload these records, navigate to the **\\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\** directory in PowerShell
and run the following script:
```
.\HealthcareDemo.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> -Operation BulkPatientAdmission
```
A browser window appears asking for credentials. Log in using the
credentials for the Chris\_CareLineManager account. The PowerShell
window shows the progress of the upload. (If permissions are not
set correctly, this step results in an error. For more information, see "Grant
permissions in Azure Active Directory" in the deployment documentation
for more information.

To confirm the addition of the new records, log into the Azure dashboard
using the Danny\_DBAnalyst account. In the SQL query window, run the
following query:
```
SELECT COUNT (*)
  FROM [dbo].[PatientData]
```

It should report 100,010 records, 10 more than after import step.

## Option step - Patient discharge (Care Line Manager role)


Chris, the care line manager, is also responsible for keeping track of
patient discharges by uploading discharges in FHIR format. As with the
admission records, the discharge records are stored in individual .json
files, in the \\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\discharge directory.

To upload these records, navigate to the **\\Deployment\\scripts\\demoscripts\\** directory in PowerShell
and run the following script:
```
.\HealthcareDemo.ps1 -deploymentPrefix <deployment-prefix> -Operation BulkPatientDischarge
```

A browser window appears asking for credentials. Log in using the
credentials for the Chris\_CareLineManager account. The PowerShell
window shows the progress of the upload. To confirm the discharges,
log into the Azure dashboard using the Danny\_DBAnalyst account. In the
SQL query window, run the following query:
```
SELECT TOP 20 *
  FROM [dbo].[PatientData]
  ORDER BY EId DESC
```

It shows that the six most recently admitted patients have been
discharged.

## Machine learning (Data Scientist role)


Machine learning enables computers to learn from data and experiences
and to act without being explicitly programmed. The length-of-stay
solution includes two Azure Machine Learning experiments written in the
R statistical programming language that can be used to predict how long
a newly admitted patient is likely to remain in the hospital.

To work with these experiments, visit the Azure Machine Learning Studio
website at <https://uswestcentral.studio.azureml.net/> and log in using
the Debra\_DataScientist account. Click the server drop-down list in the
upper right, select **West Central US** as the region, and then ensure
that the correct resource group (the one beginning with your deployment
prefix) is selected under **Workspace**. Two experiments display.

-   *Healthcare.Blueprint-Predicting Length of Stay in Hospitals* runs
    when the historical training data is ingested and when patients are
    discharged. It imports each patient record into a multidimensional
    space in which each column containing relevant health
    information---gender, pulse rate, body mass index, blood glucose
    level, and so forth---is plotted in its own dimension.

-   *Healthcare.Blueprint.Predictive Experiment - Predicting Length of
    Stay in Hospitals* is the predictive experiment. For each new
    patient, it plots the patient's intake statistics in the
    multidimensional space and uses a clustering model to predict a
    discharge date based on the length-of-stay figures of other patients
    that are close to it.

You can modify these experiments and create new ones to explore new
machine learning possibilities. For more information, see [Azure Machine Learning Studio
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio/)
for more information about Machine Learning Studio and working with
experiments.

## STEP 3 - Data visualization (Chief Medical Information Officer and Care Line Manager roles)


The solution provides a simple Microsoft PowerBI visualization of the
solution. [Microsoft
PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) is
required to open the sample report located (Using PowerBi free edition works for this demo, but will not allow for reports to be shared)
Blueprint\\Deployment\\Reports\\



> ![](images/image7.png)

To use the report, you will be required to download a local copy of both fills located in the reports folder.
- Healthcare-CLM,CMIO Report.pbix
- Microsoft_DIM.xlsx

The xlsx file provides local look up of data to help create additional dimension to the results.


The PBIX file contains cached data when first opened. To connect it to
your live data source:

1.  In the Home tab of the Ribbon, click **Edit queries** on the Home
    tab of the Ribbon, and then click **Data source settings**.

> ![](images/image5.png)

2.  Select the database and click **Change source**. This will be required for the Microsoft_DIM.xlsx file as well.
> ![](images/powerbidatasource.PNG)


3.  In the **Server** text box, change the name of the server to
    <sql-server-name>.database.windows.net. You can find the SQL
    server name in the Azure dashboard. Click **OK**.

4.  Click **Edit permissions**, and then click **Edit**.

5.  In the left column, select **Database**. Enter SqlAdmin under **User
    name**, and enter the global deployment password under **Password**.
    Click **Save**.

6.  Click **OK**, and then click **Close**.

7. Repeat the process and update the source location of the **Microsoft_DIM.xlsx** file.

7.  In the Ribbon, click **Refresh**. Data is loaded from the
    database.

If you receive an error saying that your IP is not allowed, you need to grant permission for the computer that Power BI is running on to
access the database. Log in to the Azure dashboard using the
Danny\_DBAnalyst account, click **SQL databases** in the left column,
select the correct database, and click **Set server firewall** in the
bar at top right.

![](images/image6.png)

If you are logged in to the Azure dashboard on the computer on which
Power BI is running, you can click **Add client IP** to automatically
grant the computer access to the database. Otherwise, enter the IP
address manually. Click **Save** and you should be able to connect to
the database by clicking **Refresh** again in Power BI.
